# geostar
The geostar package provides a set of useful tools for common tasks undertaken by subsurface and surface professionals concerned with spatial data. The package talkes it's name from these individuals who may consider some element of what they work on to be a 'geo*' subject like: geology, geography, geophysics etc...

## navigation data calculation

This tool accepts two inputs, a list of markers with the geospatial coordinates (X & Y locations) and a list of lines that are defined by those marker locations. This tool works for 2D seismic data or GPR surveys, where a larger survey may be defined by a subset of well defined points.
